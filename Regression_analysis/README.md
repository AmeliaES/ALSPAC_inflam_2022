# Statstical analysis

Negative binomial regression was carried out on inflammatory markers and number of depression episodes and psychotic like experiences.

The exposures included:
- inflammatory blood markers (CRP and IL-6) at age 9 years.
- DNA methylation scores of CRP and IL-6 from blood samples taked at age 7 years.
- PRSs of CRP and IL-6 from blood samples. 

Outcome measures included:
- Number of depression episodes (defined as a SMFQ score > 11) at 11 time points between ages 10 and 28 years.
- Number of psychotic like experiences (defined as answering yes or maybe to the 3 questions: Heard something other people can't hear, seen something other people can't see or feel like you are being followed) at 7 time points between ages 11 and 26 years.

Covariates are detailed in [Figure 1](https://github.com/AmeliaES/ALSPAC_inflam_episodes/blob/main/Manuscript/Figures/Fig1.tiff?raw=true) of the manuscript.
